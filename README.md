# The PROtractor
**Putting the "Pro" in PROtractor.**  Why do protractors only list degrees but most of our math formulas use radians?  What's the relationship to radians?  The PROtractor is here to the rescue!  This simple protractor layout for a laser etcher (or just printing on plain paper) includes degrees, radians, and a unit circle marked into 3.14 sections.

## Features

- Degree Marks (0°-180° and 180°-0°)
- Radian Marks (0, π/6, π/4, π/3, π/2, 2π/3, 3π/4, 5π/6, π)
- Unit Circle
- Compass (draw 1/2"-5" diameter circles in 1/2" increments)
- English Ruler (0-3", 1/10" increments)
- Metric Ruler (0-76mm, 1mm increments)
- Hole for keychain or binder

## Making a PROtractor

1) Load the appropiate AI file in Illustrator (or use the appropiate PDF)
2) Etch on a laser etcher.

*Note: Flipping horizontally is recommended such that the etched side is the side that touches the paper to reduce parallax.*
