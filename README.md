# The PROtractor
**Putting the "Pro" in PROtractor.**

> I don't know what's the matter with people: they don't learn by understanding; they learn by some other way – by rote or something. Their knowledge is so fragile! - *Richard Feynman*

Learn by understanding!  Why do protractors only list degrees but most of our math formulas use radians?  What's the relationship to radians?  The PROtractor is here to the rescue!  This simple protractor layout for a laser etcher (or just printing on plain paper) includes degrees, radians, and a unit circle marked into 3.14 sections.

- **Radian Marks** - 0.1 radian increments plus π/6, π/4, π/3, π/2, 2π/3, 3π/4, 5π/6, π
- **Unit Circle** - 1 radian wedge clearly marked
- **Compass** - Draw 1/2"-5" diameter circles in 1/2" increments
- **English Ruler** - 0-3", 1/16" increments
- **Metric Ruler** - 0-76mm, 1mm increments
- **Hole** for keychain, binder, or pencil (because...fidget!)
- **Business-card size** - Easily fits in pocket

## Making a PROtractor

### Printer
1) Load the appropiate AI file in Illustrator (or use the appropaite PDF)
2) Print the image, being sure to set printer scale to 100%

### Laser Cutter
1) Load the appropiate AI file in Illustrator (or use the appropiate PDF)
2) Etch onto an acrylic sheet on a laser cutter/etcher
*Note: Flipping horizontally is recommended such that the etched side is the side that touches the paper to reduce parallax.*

## Why the PROtractor?
 - Makes the relationship between degrees and radians obvious
 - Makes it easy to do a "reality check" on radian calculations
 - Makes the relationship between the unit circle and radians clear
 - Built-in "compass" makes it easy to draw circles (for fun, draw a circle and derive π using only the PROtractor and a piece of string!)
 - Compact, simple-to-use protractor, is easy to carry
 - A #2 Ticonderoga pencil in the hexagonal hole makes a great fidget toy (pro tip: scale the hole to a height of 0.29" to accommodate a [Blackwing](https://www.thethackery.com/default/art-supplies/pencils/writing-pencils/palomino-blackwing.html) Pencil)
